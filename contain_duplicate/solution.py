# given an array nums, return true if any value appperas at least twice in the array,
# and return false if every element is distinct

# Example 1: 
# input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
# output: true 

# Example 2: 
# Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# output: false 

**Hash map is also know as dictionary**
Use a hash set when you need to efficiently check for the presence of elements in a collection 
and ensure uniqueness (no duplicates).
A common use case is when you want to find unique elements or 
identify whether there is any overlap between two collections.

Hash table store key-value pairs and the key is generated through a function called hash function
